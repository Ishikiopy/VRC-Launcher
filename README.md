   <br />
   Majority of these functions are created to lower the amount of work the user has to do to get the most out of the game.<br /><br />
   Functions like Empty VRC-Chache can fix certain lag spikes, Bullshit Closer can help to gain more FPS with weak CPUs, and more.<br /><br />
   The program has been tested a lot in the last days and performed very well, in case you do encounter a bug let me know.<br /><br />
